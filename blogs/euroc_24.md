On the 4th day of EuRoC, our rocket “Airmedh” successfully launched in Ponte de Sor, Portugal!🚀🚀 This marks a major milestone for ULAS-HiPR, a team founded about a year ago with the long-term goal of competing at EuRoC, Europe’s largest high-powered rocketry competition. We’re proud to officially achieve this goal and represent the Republic of Ireland at such a prestigious event! 🇮🇪

Throughput this experience we loved learning and collaborating with talented teams from across Europe and engaging with industry experts. We will definitely take the lessons learned from this competition and apply them to future projects.

Huge congratulations to all the participating teams, and a massive thank you to our ULAS-HiPR team for their dedication and effort, as well as to our sponsors and supporters for their invaluable backing!
