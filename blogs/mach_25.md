Last week, our Mach 25 team travelled to Machrihanish for the Mach 25 competition, with our rocket named â€œMacha.

Not only did Macha have a successful launch, but it placed 2nd overall in the Cat2 category among university teams from across Ireland, the UK and Pakistan! 

This is a serious proud accomplishment for the overall team. At Mach 24 (our first-ever competition just a year ago), we placed near the bottom, although we learned a lot, especially for our first-ever competition, we knew we could do better.

Macha was a 1.92m, lab-built composite rocket, carrying our deployable cansat, which mapped safe and unsafe landing zones during descent. Macha reached an apogee of 2,273m, 2% of our predicted apogee, with minimal drift, a huge success for our team.

A big thank you to our various academic sponsors for supporting us in making this amazing rocket. We look forward to what is next.
